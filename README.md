# My GitHub Projects

Welcome to my GitHub profile! Here, you'll find various projects that include programming, electronics, and other interesting topics I am exploring.

## 🚀 Technologies

- **C#**: My primary backend development language.
- **React.js**: I work on the frontend and enjoy using Vite.
- **Python**: I use it for task automation and data analysis.
- **Arduino**: I work on sensor and electronics projects.
- **Docker & Azure**: I use these for development, testing, and deployment of applications.
- **Neon Blue**: My favorite color for design and themes.

## 🛠️ Projects

### 🦅 **Dental Office App** (React & C#)
A project for a dental office with data on patients, interventions, images, and documentation. The goal is to create an efficient and intuitive system with a database, using React for the frontend and C# for the backend.

### 💡 **Pressure Sensor & Arduino**
I am working on an Arduino project that measures pressure on a turbine using an ST7789 LCD screen and a 12V battery. This project helps me learn more about electronics and microcontrollers.

### 🛠️ **Azure Functions & Python Automation**
I automate processes using Python scripts in Azure Functions. Integration with FTP servers and processing CSV files is part of my workflow.

### ⚙️ **TODO List App**
I am developing a task-tracking app using React, which allows users to easily add, edit, and delete tasks.

## 📈 Interests

- **Motorcycles**: I'm passionate about adventure motorcycles and always looking for new challenges on two wheels.
- **Drones**: I'm fascinated by drones and often use them to test new technologies.
- **Coffee**: Coffee is my source of energy during intense work sessions.
- **Coding**: Coding allows me to create innovative solutions and improve various aspects of life.

## 🎯 Goals

- Continue learning and improving in **C#**, **React.js**, and **Arduino**.
- Develop more projects in **electronics** and **IoT**.
- Integrate all my projects into a **cloud** environment (Azure, Docker) for more efficient workflows.
- Build a community of like-minded developers.
